It's me, Friendtron!
Here are my commands:
!friendtronhelp: You're reading it!!
!dni / !DNI :  "Do Not Interact", ignores the entirety of the message body. I will not respond or add reactions. 
!friendtronchannel : Designate the current channel of the message as a home channel for me! I'll talk here as much as I want :)
!friendtronblacklist : Designate this channel as a channel I can not talk or interact in ever!! You really hate Friendtron this much?
!friendtronresetchannel : I throw away what I know about this channel, and treat it like a regular channel, with a lower rate of interacting

!pick <option1>, <option2>, or <option3>, <option...> : I randomly select one item in a list of arbitrary length. Options MUST be separated by a comma and space or the sequence ", or "; these can be used interchangeably.

!fmk <option1>, <option2>, or <option3>, <option...> : I play F***, Marry, Kill with a list of AT LEAST three names. Same rules as !pick.

!roll <max> : I roll for a random number, like a die. I.e. !roll 20 means I will roll a 20 sided die, and report my result.

!name <OPTIONAL amount> : I output a random name! Give a numeric amount to retrieve multiple names at once.

!nametown <OPTIONAL amount> I come up with a random town name, using common town affixes to my known names. Give a numeric amount to retrieve multiple names at once.

!joinvoice: I join the voice channel that the caller is in, and attempt to listen to the system microphone designated in the script. I will continue listening, and make synthesized voice responses. Until Discord.py incorporates voice channel listening, this is the best I can do.

Rock, Paper, Scissors commands:
!rock : play Rock

!paper : play Paper

!scissors : play Scissors

!score : I list all recorded scores of players, including my own.
